## Instalation

Get the stable version from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("checkdown")
```

â€¦ or get the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("agricolamz/checkdown")
```

## 1. Demo

The main goal of this package to create checking fields and boxes in `rmarkdown`. It could be used in class, when teacher share materials and tasks, so student can solve some problems and check themselves. It is really important since some students are too shy to ask a question, so you can create tasks that will check on the fly the understanding of the class material and give some hints to those students that get stuck. In contrast to the [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html) package the `checkdown` package works without `shiny` and could be stored as a simple `.html` page (e. g. on Github Pages). In contrast to the [`exams`](http://www.r-exams.org/) output the `checkdown` package creates intaractive autochecking tasks. The interactive virsion of the [`exams`](http://www.r-exams.org/) output is bind to Blackboard Learn, that is really nice, but looks like an overkill for the simple task that `checkdown` solves.

Load the library:

```{r}
library(checkdown)
```

### 1.1 Ask question with the `check_question()` function

Imagine that we want to create a checkbox with the answer 4. All you need is to create a following chunk with the chunck atribute `results='asis'` in your `rmarkdown` document:
```{r, results='asis'}
check_question(answer =  4)
```

It is possible to change wrong and right answer's messages using `wrong` and `right` arguments of the `check_question()` function. Let's create some more questions.

Solve 3+3:
```{r, results='asis'}
check_question(answer =  6, right = "correct", wrong = "not correct")
```

Type *la-la*:
```{r, results='asis'}
check_question(answer =  "la-la")
```

Number of answers is not limited:
```{r, results='asis'}
check_question(answer =  1:5)
```

It is also possible to create a list of answers for students to choose:

```{r, results="asis"}
check_question("banana", options = c("apple", "banana", "bread"))

check_question("banana", options = c("apple", "banana", "bread"), type = "radio")
check_question(c("banana", "apple"), options = c("apple", "banana", "bread"), type = "checkbox")
```

If the list of possible answers is small, it is possible to align them in one line using `alignment` argument:

```{r, results="asis"}
check_question("banana", options = c("apple", "banana", "bread"), type = "radio", alignment = TRUE)
```

You can shuffle answers using the `random_answer_order` argument:
```{r, results="asis"}
check_question("banana", options = c("apple", "banana", "bread"), type = "radio", random_answer_order = TRUE)
```

### 1.2 Give some hints with the `check_hint()` function

Sometimes you now in advance what kind of mistakes will your students do. Some students are shy and don't like ask questions, so hints could partially solve  this problem. Again all you need is to create a following chunk with the chunck atribute `results='asis'` in your `rmarkdown` document:

```{r, results="asis"}
check_hint("You can use the rmarkdown package")
```

Of course it is possible to change the message:
```{r, results="asis"}
check_hint("You can use the rmarkdown package inside checkdown",
           hint_title = "CLICK HERE")
```

It is possible to use Markdown inside messages:

```{r, results="asis"}
check_hint("* You can use the `markdown` **inside** the [`chcekdown` package](https://agricolamz.github.io/checkdown/)",
           hint_title = "Click he`R`e")
check_question(answer =  4, 
               wrong = "a**R**e you su**R**e", 
               right = "### `R`ight")
```

There is also a function for multiple hints:

```{r, results="asis"}
check_hints(hint_text = c("look into the hint 2", "look into the hint 1"),
            hint_title = c("hint 1", "hint 2"), 
            list_title = "list of hints")
```

## 2. Inserting images

Sometimes it is nice to use images as a question. It also could be useful to insert images in hints. In order to do it you need to use `insert_images()` function, and enumerate the correct answer.

```{r, results="asis"}
check_question(answer = 3, 
               type = "radio",
               options = insert_images(c("windows.png", 
                                         "mac.png",
                                         "linux.png"), 
                                         image_width = 30))
```

Arguments `image_width` and `image_height` also except vector of values in case you need different size for different pictures. It is also possible to create a picture during the session, save it and use in `checkdown` functions.

```{r}
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(mpg, disp)) + geom_point()
ggsave(filename = tmp)
```

Let's use obtained picture in the hint (notice, how I used percantage in the `image_width` argument):

```{r, results="asis"}
check_hint(paste("Here is our plot: <br>", 
                 insert_images(tmp, image_width = "40%")))
```

## 3. Some important notes

* It is possible to avoid code in the output `.html`. Just use the chunk argument `echo=FALSE`.
* For now the package `checkdown` works only with html output and will not print anything for other otputs.
* Be careful with number precision: rounding could be different on different computers so if you ask your student to calculate `log(3/4)` it is possible that they will see only 6 or 7 numbers after the comma. So it make sence explicitly specify precision using `round()` function.

```{r, results="asis"}
log(3/4)
check_question(answer =  round(log(3/4), 6))
```
