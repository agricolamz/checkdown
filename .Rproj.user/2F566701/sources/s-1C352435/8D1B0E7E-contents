# Introduction to R and RStudio {#intro}

## Introduction
### Why data science?
Data science is a new field that is actively developing lately. This field merges computer science, mathematics, statistics, and it is hard to say how much science in data science. In many scientific fields a new data science paradigm arises and even forms a new sub-field:

* Bioinformatics
* Crime data analysis
* Digital humanities
* Data journalism
* Data driven medicine
* ...

There are a lot of new books "Data Science for ...":

* psychologists [@hansjoerg19]
* immunologists [@thomas19]
* business [@provost13]
* public policy [@brooks13]
* fraud detection [@baesens15]
* ...

Data scientists need to be able to:

* gather data
* transform data
* visualize data
* create a statistical model based on data
* share and represent the results of this work
* organize the whole workflow in a reproducible way

### Why R?

R [@r19] is a programming language with a big infrastructure of packages that helps to work in different fields of science and computer technology.

There are several alternatives:

* Python [@vanderplas16; @grus19]
* Julia [@bezanson17]
* bash [@janssens14]
* java [@brzustowicz17]
* ...

You can find some R answers here:

* R for data science [@wickham16], it is online
* [R community](https://community.rstudio.com/)
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
* any search engine you use
* ...

## Introduction to RStudio
R is the programming language. RStudio is the most popular IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R language.

When you open RStudio for the first time you can see something like this:

![](images/01.01.rstudio.png)

When you press ![](images/01.02.rstudio_button.png) button at the top of the left window you will be able to see all four panels of RStudio.

![](images/01.03.rstudio.png)

## R as a calculator

Lets first start with the calculator. Press in R console

```{r}
2+9
50*(9-20)
3^3
9^0.5
9+0.5
9+.5
pi
```

Remainder after division

```{r}
10 %% 3
```

```{block, type = "rmdtask"}
So you are ready to solve some really hard equations (round it four decimal places):
```


$$\frac{\pi+2}{2^{3-\pi}}$$


```{r, include = FALSE}
(pi+3)/(2^(3-pi))
```

<form name="Form1" onsubmit="return validateForm1()" method="post">
<input type="text" name="answer1">
<input type="submit" value="check">
</form><br>

<details> <summary> üìã list of hints ‚û° </summary> 

<details> <summary> üëÅ Are you sure that you rounded the result? ‚û° </summary>
I expect the answer to be rounded to four decimal places: `0.87654321` becomes `0.8765`.<br>
</details>

<details> <summary> üëÅ Are you sure you didn't get into the brackets trap? ‚û° </summary>
Even though there isn't any brackets in the mathematical notation, you need to add them in R, otherwise the operation order will be wrong. <br>
</details>


</details>

## Comments

Any text after a hash `#` within the same line is considered a comment. 

```{r}
2+2 # it is four

# you can put any comments here
3+3
```


## Functions

The most important part of R is functions: here are some of them:

```{r}
sqrt(4)
abs(-5)
sin(pi/2)
cos(pi)
sum(2, 3, 9)
prod(5, 3, 9)
sin(cos(pi))
```

Each function has a name and zero or more arguments. All arguments of the function should be listed in parenthesis and separated by comma:

```{r}
pi
round(pi, 2)
```

Each function's argument has its own name and serial number. If you use names of the function's arguments, you can put them in any order. If you do not use names of the function's arguments, you should put them according the serial number.

```{r}
round(x = pi, digits = 2)
round(digits = 2, x = pi)
round(x = pi, d = 2)
round(d = 2, x = pi)
round(pi, 2)
round(2, pi) # this is not the same as all previous!
```

There are some functions without any arguments, but you still should use parenthesis:

```{r}
Sys.Date() # correct
Sys.Date # wrong
```

Each function in R is documented. You can read its documentation typing a question mark before the function name:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?Sys.Date
```

```{block, type = "rmdtask"}
Explore the function `log()` and calculate the following logarithm:
```

$$\log_3(3486784401)$$

```{r, include=FALSE}
log(3486784401, base = 3)
```

<form name="Form2" onsubmit="return validateForm2()" method="post">
<input type="text" name="answer2">
<input type="submit" value="check">
</form><br>

<details> <summary> üìã list of hints ‚û° </summary> 

<details> <summary> üëÅ A-a-a! I don't remember anything about logarithms... ‚û°</summary>
The logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a given number *x* is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base *b*, must be raised, to produce that number *x*.

$$10^n = 1000,\text{ what is n?}$$
$$n = \log_{10}(1000)$$
<br>
</details>

<details> <summary> üëÅ What does this small 3 in the task mean? ‚û°</summary>
This is the base of the logarithm. So the task is: what is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base *3*, must be raised, to produce that number *3486784401*. <br>
</details>

</details>

## Variables

Everything in R can be stored in a variable:

```{r}
x <- 5 + 6
```

![](images/01.04.variable.png)
As a result, no output in the Console, and a new variable *x* appear in the Environment window. From now on I can use this new variable:

```{r}
x + x
sum(x, x, 7)
```

All those operations don't change the variable value. In order to change the variable value you need to make a new assignment:

```{r}
x <- 5 + 6 + 7
```

The fast way for creating `<-` in RStudio is to press `Alt -` on your keyboard.

It is possible to use equal sign `=` for assignment operation, but the recommendations are to use arrow `<-` for the assignment, and equal sign `=` for giving arguments' value inside the functions.

For removing vector you need to use the function `rm()`:

```{r error = TRUE}
rm(x)
x
```


### Variable comparison

It is possible to compare different variables

```{r}
x <- 18
x > 18
x >= 18
x < 100
x <= 18
x == 18
x != 18
```

Operator `!` can work by itself changing logical values into reverse:

```{r}
!TRUE
!FALSE
```


### Variable types

There are several types of variables in R. In this course the only important types will be `double` (all numbers), `character` (or strings), and `logical`:

```{r}
x <- 2+3
typeof(x)
y <- "Cze≈õƒá"
typeof(y)
z <- TRUE
typeof(z)
```

## Vector
An R object that contains multiple values of the same type is called **vector**. It could be created with the command `c()`:

```{r}
c(3, 0, pi, 23.4, -53)
c("Krak√≥w", "Warszawa", "Cieszyn")
c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

a <- c(2, 3, 4)
b <- c(5, 6, 7)
c(a, b)
```

For the number sequences there is an easy way:

```{r}
1:10
3:-5
```

From now on you can understand that everything we have seen before is a vector of length one. That is why there is `[1]` in all outputs: it is just an index of elements in a vector. Have a look here:

```{r}
1:60
60:1
```

There is also a function `sec()` for creation of arithmetic progressions:

```{r}
1:20
seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 1)
seq(from = 2, to = 100, by = 13)
```


```{block, type = "rmdtask"}
Use the argument `length.out` of function `seq()` and create an arithmetic sequence from $\pi$ to $2\pi$ of length 50.

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
seq(pi, 2*pi, length.out = 50)
```

There are also some built-in vectors:

```{r}
letters
LETTERS
month.name
month.abb
```

### Vector coercion
Vectors are R objects that contain multiple values of **the same type**. But what if we merged together different types?

```{r}
c(1, "34")
c(1, TRUE)
c(TRUE, "34")
```

It is clear that there is a hierarchy: strings > double > logical. It is not universal across different programming languages. It doesn't correspond to the amount of values of particular type:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, "34")
c(1, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
```

The same story could happen during other operations:

```{r}
5+TRUE
```

### Vector operations

All operations, that we discussed earlier, could be done with vectors of the same length:

```{r}
1:5 + 6:10
1:5 - 6:10
1:5 * 6:10
```

There are operations where the vector of any length and vector of length one is involved:

```{r}
1:5 + 7
1:5 - 7
1:5 / 7
```

There are a lot of functions in R that are **vectorised**. That means that applying this function to a vector is the same as applying this function to each element of the vector:

```{r}
sin(1:5)
sqrt(1:5)
abs(-5:3)
```

### Indexing vectors

How to get some value or banch of values from a vector? You need to index them:

```{r}
x <- c(3, 0, pi, 23.4, -53)
y <- c("Krak√≥w", "Warszawa", "Cieszyn")

x[4]
y[2]
```

It is possible to have a vector as index:

```{r}
x[1:2]
y[c(1, 3)]
```

It is possible to index something that you **do not** want to see in the result:
```{r}
y[-2]
x[-c(1, 4)]
```

It is possible to have other variables as an index

```{r}
z <- c(3, 2)
x[z]
y[z]
```

It is possible to index with a logical vector:

```{r}
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
```

That means that we could use `TRUE/FALSE`-vector produced by comparison:

```{r}
x[x > 2]
```

It works because `x > 2` is a vector of logical values:

```{r}
x > 2
```


It is possible to use `!` operator here changing all `TRUE` values to `FALSE` and vice versa.

```{r}
x[!(x > 2)]
```


```{block, type = "rmdtask"}
How many elements in the vector `g` if expression `g[pi < 1000]` does not return an error?
```

### `NA`

Sometimes there are some missing values in the data, so it is represented with `NA`
```{r}
NA
c(1, NA, 9)
c("Krak√≥w", NA, "Cieszyn")
c(TRUE, FALSE, NA)
```

It is possible to check, whether there are missing values or not

```{r}
x <- c("Krak√≥w", NA, "Cieszyn")
y <- c("Krak√≥w", "Warszawa", "Cieszyn")
is.na(x)
is.na(y)
```

Some functions doesn't work with vecotors that contain missed values, so you need to add argument `na.rm = TRUE`:


```{r}
x <- c(1, NA, 9, 5)
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
min(x, na.rm = TRUE)
max(x, na.rm = TRUE)
median(x, na.rm = TRUE)
range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```



## Packages

The most important and useful part of R is hidden in its packages. Everything that we discussed so far is basic R functionality invented back in 1979. Since then a lot of different things changed, so all new practices for data analysis, visualisation and manipulation are packed in packages. During our class we will learn the most popular *"dialect"* of R called `tidyverse`.

In order to install packages you need to use a command. Let's install the `tidyverse` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

For today we also will need the `readxl` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readxl")
```

After you have downloaded packages nothing will change. You can not use any fucntionality from packages unless you load the package with the `library()` function:

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

Not loading package is the most popular mistake of my students. So remember:

* `install.packages("...")` is like you are buying a screwdriver set;
* `library("...")` is like you are stusing art your screwdriver.

![](images/01.05.install-packages-vs-library.png)

For the further lectures we will need `tidyverse` package.

```{block, type = "rmdtask"}
Please install `tidyverse` package and load it.
```


### `tidyverse`

The [`tidyverse`](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/) is a set of packages:

* `tibble`, for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames --- analugue of tables in R
* `readr`, for data import
* `dplyr`, for data manipulation
* `tidyr`, for data tidying (we will discuss it later today)
* `ggplot2`, for data visualisation
* `purrr`, for functional programming

## Dataframe (tibble)


A data frame is a collection of variables of the same number of rows with unique row names. Here is an example dataframe with the Tomm Moore filmography:

```{r}
moore_filmography <- tibble(title = c("The Secret of Kells", 
                                      "Song of the Sea", 
                                      "Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet", 
                                      "The Breadwinner", 
                                      "Wolfwalkers"),
                            year = c(2009, 2014, 2014, 2017, 2020),
                            director = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
moore_filmography
```

There are a lot of built-in dataframes:

```{r}
mtcars
iris
```

You can find information about them:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?mtcars
?iris
```

Dataframe consists of vectors that could be called using `$` sign:

```{r}
moore_filmography$year
moore_filmography$title
```

It is possible to add a vector to an existing dataframe:

```{r}
moore_filmography$producer <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
moore_filmography
```

There are some useful functions that tell you somethig about a dataframe:

```{r}
nrow(moore_filmography)
ncol(moore_filmography)
summary(moore_filmography)
str(moore_filmography)
```

We will work exclusively with dataframes. But it is not the only data structure in R.


```{block, type = "rmdtask"}
How many rows are in the `iris` dataframe?
```

<form name="Form4" onsubmit="return validateForm4()" method="post">
<input type="text" name="answer4">
<input type="submit" value="check">
</form><br>

```{r, include = FALSE}
nrow(iris)
```

```{block, type = "rmdtask"}
How many columns are in the `mtcars` dataframe?
```

<form name="Form4" ons5bmit="return validateForm4()" m5thod="post">
<input type="text" name="answer4">
<i5put type="submit" value="check">
</form><br>

```{r, include = FALSE}
ncol(mtcars)
```


### Indexing dataframes

Since dataframes are two-dimensional objects it is possible to index its rows and columns. Rows are the first index, columns are the second index:

```{r}
moore_filmography[3, 2]
moore_filmography[3,]
moore_filmography[,2]
moore_filmography[,1:2]
moore_filmography[,-3]
moore_filmography[,-c(1:2)]
moore_filmography[,"year"]
moore_filmography[,c("title", "year")]
moore_filmography[moore_filmography$year > 2014,]
```

## Data import

### `.csv` files

A `.csv`  files (comma-separated values) is a delimited text file that uses a comma (or other delemeters such as tabulation or semicolon) to separate values. It is broadly used bacause it is possible to parse such a file using computers and people can edit it in the Office programs (Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, Numbers on Mac). Here is our `moore_filmography` dataset in the `.csv` format:

```
title,year,director,producer
The Secret of Kells,2009,TRUE,TRUE
Song of the Sea,2014,TRUE,TRUE
Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet,2014,TRUE,FALSE
The Breadwinner,2017,FALSE,TRUE
Wolfwalkers,2020,TRUE,TRUE
```

Let's create a variable with this file:

```{r}
our_csv <- "title,year,director,producer
The Secret of Kells,2009,TRUE,TRUE
Song of the Sea,2014,TRUE,TRUE
Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet,2014,TRUE,FALSE
The Breadwinner,2017,FALSE,TRUE
Wolfwalkers,2020,TRUE,TRUE"
```

Now we are ready to use `read_csv()` function:

```{r}
read_csv(our_csv)
```


It is also possible to read files from your computer. Download [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agricolamz/2020.02_Naumburg_R/master/data/moore_filmography.csv) file on your computer (press `Ctrl S` or `Cmd S`) and read into R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_csv("C:/path/to/your/file/moore_filmography.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
read_csv(our_csv)
```


It is also possible to read files from the Internet:

```{r}

read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agricolamz/2020.02_Naumburg_R/master/data/moore_filmography.csv")
```

```{block, type = "rmdtask"}
Because of the 2019‚Äì20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak the city of Wuhan is on media everywhere. [In Russian](https://nplus1.ru/blog/2020/02/03/wuhan) for some reason Wuhan is sometimes masculine and sometimes it is feminin. I looked into other Slavic languages and recorded obtained data into the [`.csv` file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/agricolamz/c280527d6b5d79693b85d8fcf8d35bc3/raw/c46a32a218bc5d6933703ae677b81ff5a4a1dcaa/wuhan.csv). Download this files to R. What variables does it have?
```

All file manipulations in R are somehow connected with space on your computer via working directory. You can get information about your current working directory using `getwd()` function. You can change your working directory using `setwd()` function. If a file you want to read is in the working directory you don't need to write the whole path to file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
read_csv("moore_filmography.csv")
```

The same simple function will create your `.csv` file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write_csv(moore_filmography, "moore_filmography_v2.csv")
```


Sometimes reading `.csv` files into Microsoft Excel is complicated, please follow the [following instructions](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-convert-a-text-txt-csv-file-into-an-excel-file).

### `.xls` and `.xlsx` files


There is a package `readxl` that allows to open and save `.xsl` and `.xslx` files. Install and load the package:


```{r}
library(readxl)
```

Here is a [test file](https://github.com/agricolamz/2020.02_Naumburg_R/raw/master/data/moore_filmography.xlsx). Download it to your computer and put it to your working directory:


```{r, eval= FALSE}
read_xlsx("moore_filmography.xlsx")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
read_xlsx("data/moore_filmography.xlsx")
```

`.xls` and `.xlsx` files could have multiple tables on different sheets:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_xlsx("moore_filmography.xlsx", sheet = "iris")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
read_xlsx("data/moore_filmography.xlsx", sheet = "iris")
```

## Rmarkdown

If you press `Ctrl S` or `Cmd S` then you will save your script. There is also another useful type of coding in R: `rmarkown`. First install this package:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```



Then it will be possible to create a new file: `File > New File > R Markdown...`.

![](images/01.06.rmarkdown.png)

Press `OK` in the following menu and you will get the template of your R Markdown file. You can modify it, then press ![](images/01.07.knit.png) and the result file will be created in your working directory. `rmarkdown` package is a really popular and well developed package that creates output into:


* markdown
* html
* docx
* pdf
* beamer presentation
* pptx presentation
* epub
* ...
* multiple templates for different scientific journals (package `rticsles` and `papaja`)
* ...


`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) '
<script>
function validateForm1() {
    var x = document.forms["Form1"]["answer1"].value;
    if (x != "6.77495.6718    
        alert("I have a different answer...");
        return false;
    } else {
        alert("Correct!");
        return false;
    }
}
function validateForm2() {
    var x = document.forms["Form2"]["answer2"].value;
    if (x != "20") {
        alert("I have a different answer...");
        return false;
    } else {
        alert("Correct!");
        return false;
    }
}
function validateForm4() {
    var x = document.forms["Form4"]["answer4"].value;
    if (x != "150") {
        alert("I have a different answer...");
        return false;
    } else {
        alert("Correct!");
        return false;
    }
}
function validateForm5() {
    var x = document.forms["Form5"]["answer5"].value;
    if (x != "11") {
        alert("I have a different answer...");
        return false;
    } else {
        alert("Correct!");
        return false;
    }
}
</script>
'`
